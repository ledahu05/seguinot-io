# Quarto Game Rules

## Overview

Quarto is a two-player abstract strategy game. A typical game lasts 10-20 minutes and is suitable for players aged 6 and up.

## Game Components

### Board
- A 4x4 grid with 16 squares

### Pieces
- 16 unique pieces, each with four distinct binary characteristics:
  - **Color**: Light or Dark
  - **Shape**: Round or Square
  - **Top**: Solid or Hollow
  - **Height**: Tall or Short

Each piece has a unique combination of these four characteristics.

## Objective

Create an alignment of 4 pieces that share at least one common characteristic. The alignment can be:
- Horizontal
- Vertical
- Diagonal

## How to Play

1. Players alternate turns throughout the game.
2. On each turn:
   - The active player **selects a piece** from the available pieces and **gives it to their opponent**.
   - The opponent **must place** that piece on any empty square of the board.
   - The opponent then **chooses the next piece** to give back to the first player.
3. This alternating pattern continues until someone forms a winning alignment.

## Winning Conditions

A player wins by creating an alignment of 4 pieces that share at least one common characteristic and announcing **"QUARTO!"**

### Possible Winning Alignments (8 combinations)

1. Four **light** pieces
2. Four **dark** pieces
3. Four **round** pieces
4. Four **square** pieces
5. Four **solid** pieces
6. Four **hollow** pieces
7. Four **tall** pieces
8. Four **short** pieces

### Important Rule

If a player creates an alignment but **does not announce "QUARTO!"**, that alignment becomes **invalid** and cannot be claimed later.

## Advanced Variation

In addition to the standard winning conditions, players can also win by:

- Creating a **2x2 square** of 4 pieces that share at least one common characteristic.

This adds 9 additional winning possibilities to the game (the 9 possible 2x2 squares on a 4x4 board).

## Strategy Notes

- Remember: you choose which piece your opponent must play, not which piece you play yourself.
- Consider not only what alignments you can create, but what alignments you might be enabling for your opponent.
- With 16 unique pieces and 16 squares, every game that goes the full distance ends with every piece placed.
